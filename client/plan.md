# Codebase Review Plan

## Notes
- User requested a review of the codebase.
- No specific focus or issues mentioned yet.
- Project is a Node.js/Express app serving a syllabus editing/viewing web interface.
- Key files: server.js, package.json, syllabus.json, public/index.html, public/editSyllabus.html.
- User requested to consolidate server files: keep server.js, remove server-new.js.
- Found inconsistent API endpoints in editSyllabus.html; need to update POST to /api/syllabus.
- User requested to implement basic authentication for admin functions.
- Basic authentication implemented for POST /api/syllabus and admin page routes.
- User requested to add data validation, backup creation, and proper logging for syllabus updates.
- Data validation, backup creation, and logging have been implemented and documented.
- User requested to migrate the admin edit interface to React (Phase 1 of frontend modernization).
- Phase 2 complete: public viewing interface migrated to React.
- Implemented color-coded belt sections in React public view, including special striped styling for "Brown/Black Stripe" belt. Fixed mapping issues by matching UI logic to exact data values in syllabus.json.
- User requested: Each belt section should show its own techniques in bold, and all previous belts' techniques in standard (non-bold) text.
- Fixed bug: replaced all instances of 'syllabusData' with 'syllabus' in PublicApp.js to resolve undefined variable errors.
- Added state for expandedBelts and toggleBeltExpand in PublicApp.js to manage belt section expansion in the React public view.
